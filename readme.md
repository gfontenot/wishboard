#Wishboard - A Wishlist generated from [Pinboard][]

Viewing an existing wishlish is simple. Just go to `wishboard.co/<pinboard-user-name>` to see a list of items the user has marked with the tag "want". It works by parsing the public JSON feed for the user. See an example [here][my_wishboard].

Getting your wishlist displayed on Wishboard is nearly as simple. If you have a [Pinboard][] account, just start tagging items with `want`. They will automatically show up at Wishboard. If you want to get super fancy, you can use [markdown][] in the notes field, and it will be displayed correctly on Wishboard. Adding too much markup isn't recommended, but it can be handy to set up an external link, or add `em`, or `strong` to a bit of text.

Design inspired by [Brett Terpstra][]'s _fantastic_ custom pinboard stylesheet (available [here][bt-pinboard]).
