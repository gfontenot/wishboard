#Wishboard - A Wishlist generated from [Pinboard][]

Pretty basic. Just go to `wishboard.heroku.com/<pinboard-user-name>` to see a list of items you have marked with the tag "want". No signup. Works off parsing the public JSON feed for the user. See an example [here][my_wishboard]

Design inspired by [Brett Terpstra][]'s _fantastic_ custom pinboard stylesheet (available [here][bt-pinboard]).
