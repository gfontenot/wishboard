#Wishboard - A Wishlist generated from [Pinboard][]

Pretty basic. Just go to `wishboard.heroku.com/<pinboard-user-name>` to see a list of items you have marked with the tag "want". No signup. Works off parsing the public JSON feed for the user. See an example [here][my_wishboard]


Quick disclaimer: I'm _totally_ cribbing [Brett Terpstra][]'s _fantastic_ custom pinboard stylesheet (available [here][bt-pinboard]) for the styling as it exists right now. I don't know CSS at all, so it's been great to be able to dig through his and try to figure out what he's doing and how. So thanks, Brett. Huge fan.
